# MVC Library

This library's goal is to present an easy-to-use framework for maintaining complex applications that utilize the Model-View-Controller architecture.

## Features

- Convenience storage for holding centralized model specific information that can be both accessed and updated from different parts of the project.
- Handlers for dynamically updating your view, based on state specific information, as you like.

*The goal of this project is to come up with MVC techniques which would have been good to use when writing my homework for subject - Programming 3.*

It is very likely that I am going to implement the Subscriber pattern. I'd like to add as many ideas to this project as I can on the go.
